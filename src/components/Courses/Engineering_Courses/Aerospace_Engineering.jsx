                        Aerospace engineering is the branch of
                        engineering which deals with the research,
                        design, development, construction, testing,
                        of aircraft and spacecraft. It is divided into
                        two major and overlapping branches:
                        aeronautical engineering related with
                        aircrafts in the earth's atmosphere, and
                        astronautical engineering that deals with
                        spacecrafts that operate outside the earth's
                        atmosphere.
