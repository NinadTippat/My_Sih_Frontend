                        Artificial Intelligence belongs to a field of science
                        and engineering in which studies and research
                        aim to develop intelligent computer machines
                        that can perform tasks with human intelligence.
                        It includes speech recognition, visual perception,
                        logic and decision, multi-language translation and
                        more. Digital bits of data is interpreted and
                        turned into significant experiences and outcomes
                        with aid / assistance of robotics, automation and
                        sophisticated computer software and programs.
