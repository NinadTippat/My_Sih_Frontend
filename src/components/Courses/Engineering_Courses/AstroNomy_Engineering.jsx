                        Astronomy is a combination of physics, chemistry
                        and mathematical principles/rules. Astrophysics
                        can be called its offshoot. It deals with detailed
                        study of the physical, chemical and dynamic
                        properties of celestial objects. It also deals with
                        the phenomena over and above Earth's
                        atmosphere. There is associated study of
                        calculations of orbits, gravitational forces,
                        satellites, meteors, galaxies, comets, stars,
                        planetary objects, planets, satellites etc. In
                        Astrophysics, we explore and ensure
                        properties/nature of the astronomical objects
                        with the help of laws of physics and chemistry.
                        There is also the field of Cosmology which studies
                        the origin and evolution of the universe.
