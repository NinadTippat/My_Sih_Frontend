                        Dentistry deals with teeth, gums, hard and soft
                        tissues of the oral cavity. Today, dentistry is not
                        restricted to treating just tooth decays but also
                        includes cosmetic dental procedures to
                        improve a personâ€™s appearance.

                        (diagnosis for diseases that affect the mouth)
                        and orthodontics (straightening and aligning
                        teeth and jaws) are also part of the BDS course.
